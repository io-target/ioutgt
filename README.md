# ioutgt

A high-performance userspace storage target framework built on io_uring,
written in Rust. It speaks **NVMe/TCP** and **NVMe/RDMA** today; the
architecture is transport-independent and designed to grow NBD & iSCSI,
..., behind the same core.

## io_uring keeps going

I/O Batch Processing

Continuous performance optimization

New features are constantly emerging (multishot, net recv zero copy,
iopoll, io-uring slots in future, dmabuf read/write in future, ...)

## Rust

Memory safe modern programming language

Async/.await with Tokio & io_uring reactor

## userspace (compared with kernel nvme target)

Easy to develop and maintain

Crash in isolation

## Performance

Pass xfstests(./check -g quick) on nvme-tcp & nvme-rdma backed by
ioutgt target.

One process, one queue thread per NVMe queue, no locks in the data path,
single fio JOB with queue depth 128.

**NVMe/RDMA** (100 GbE mlx5, RoCEv2)

| phase | ioutgt IOPS | ioutgt BW | nvmet IOPS | nvmet BW | ioutgt vs nvmet |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 4k randread | 254.2k | 993 MiB/s | 228.7k | 894 MiB/s | **+11.1%** |
| 4k randwrite | 259.6k | 1014 MiB/s | 261.0k | 1020 MiB/s | −0.5% |
| 64k randread | 128.7k | 8044 MiB/s | 63.3k | 3957 MiB/s | **+103.3%** |
| 64k randwrite | 127.1k | 7943 MiB/s | 61.4k | 3836 MiB/s | **+107.0%** |

**NVMe/TCP** (same wire)

| phase | ioutgt IOPS | ioutgt BW | nvmet IOPS | nvmet BW | ioutgt vs nvmet |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 4k randread | 239.5k | 936 MiB/s | 111.0k | 434 MiB/s | **+115.8%** |
| 4k randwrite | 249.3k | 974 MiB/s | 116.0k | 453 MiB/s | **+114.9%** |
| 64k randread | 52.9k | 3308 MiB/s | 28.1k | 1754 MiB/s | **+88.3%** |
| 64k randwrite | 34.8k | 2176 MiB/s | 17.0k | 1062 MiB/s | **+104.7%** |

For scale: the backing SSD does 122k IOPS (7.6 GiB/s) at 64k random
locally, and the raw wire carries 98 Gb/s (`ibperf`) — the single-job
64k RDMA numbers are one queue thread saturating the drive's 64k
ceiling through one QP.

Both tables come from the in-repo realwire drivers,
`testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh` and `testing/two_nic/realwire_rdma.sh`:
target and initiator run on one host but each NIC is isolated in its own
network namespace, so the only path between them is the physical cable —
real hardware traffic, kernel host driver on the initiator side, and the
in-kernel nvmet target measured back to back on the same wire. fio ran
as a single job at qd 128, 15 s/phase, on real NVMe SSD backends, pinned
with `taskset`; post-connect the harness pins the RX/CQ IRQ placement on
both the target and the initiator side, so single-job numbers are
reproducible across reconnects instead of an RSS/vector placement
lottery. To reproduce:

```sh
export NIC_T=<port0> NIC_I=<port1>       # two cabled ports, NOT your mgmt NIC
export IOUTGT_BACKEND=/dev/nvmeXn1 NVMET_BACKEND=/dev/nvmeYn1
export NR_QUEUES=16 QUEUE_SIZE=128 FIO_JOBS=1 FIO_QD=128 FIO_SECS=15
testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh up       # or two_nic/realwire_rdma.sh
testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh start && testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh connect
taskset -c <cpu> testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh fio_perf
testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh disconnect && testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh stop
testing/two_nic/realwire_tcp.sh down
```

## Roadmap

- Performance optimization.
- Analysis & Comparison with SPDK.
- Receive zero-copy for NVMe/TCP (io_uring `RECV_ZC`).
- In-band authentication.
- Metadata/PI formats.
- Cleanup and code simplification passes.
- More targets behind the same core: NBD, iSCSI.

## Workspace layout

| Crate | Role |
|-------|------|
| `ioutgt-uring` | per-thread io_uring reactor + op futures, Tokio park integration |
| `ioutgt-nvme` | sans-io NVMe spec types + PDU codec, plus NVMe command execution: dispatch, admin/IO handlers, fabrics |
| `ioutgt-core` | protocol-neutral queue engine (slots, buffer pool, permits, `Backend`) + the structural target model (subsystems, namespaces, controller registry) |
| `ioutgt-stream` | protocol-neutral stream send/recv harness (`StreamSender`/`StreamReader`) |
| `ioutgt-nvme-tcp` | NVMe/TCP transport + binary |
| `ioutgt-nvme-rdma` | NVMe/RDMA transport + binary (verbs, CM, adaptive `--poll`) |
| `ioutgt-backend` | null / memory / file / block backends |
| `ioutgt-control` | UDS JSON control plane + config schema |
| `ioutgt-harness` | shared binary harness: spawn, queue-thread pool, control server, `stat` client |
| `ioutgt-cpus` | locality-aware even CPU grouping for topology-aware pinning |

## VM testing

The acceptance tests run the kernel NVMe host against ioutgt inside a
throwaway [virtme-ng](https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng) guest. They
need only `vng` on `PATH` — no disk image, no kernel build: the guest
boots the kernel the host is running and sees the checkout over 9p.

```sh
testing/run_interop.sh                  # the M4-M8 interop matrix
testing/run_vmtest.sh testing/vmtest/   # every guest test, with a pass/fail summary
VMTEST_KERNEL=~/git/linux-next testing/run_interop.sh   # a kernel under development
```

The harness, its knobs, and how to reuse it in another project are
described in [`testing/README.md`](testing/README.md).

## Requirements

- Linux ≥ 6.11 (`DEFER_TASKRUN` + multishot era; developed on 7.1)
- Rust ≥ 1.88 stable
- clang libs ≤ 19 for building `ioutgt-nvme-rdma`: its `rdma-mummy-sys`
  dependency runs bindgen at build time, which fails against
  clang-libs-22 (see
  [rdma-mummy-sys#24](https://github.com/RDMA-Rust/rdma-mummy-sys/issues/24));
  point `LIBCLANG_PATH` at a clang-19 install when the system clang is
  newer

## Installing

ioutgt is not published to crates.io — build it from this repository:

```sh
# the NVMe/TCP target
cargo install --git https://github.com/io-target/ioutgt ioutgt-nvme-tcp

# the NVMe/RDMA target (needs rdma-core headers; see Requirements)
cargo install --git https://github.com/io-target/ioutgt ioutgt-nvme-rdma
```

or from a checkout, which is what you want while developing:

```sh
cargo build --release -p ioutgt-nvme-tcp   # ./target/release/ioutgt-nvme-tcp
```

The workspace ships two binaries; the eight library crates behind them
(`ioutgt-core`, `ioutgt-uring`, …) are internal structure, not a public
API, and are marked `publish = false`. Their boundaries exist to enforce
the dependency rules in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) —
`ioutgt-core` must not reach for `ioutgt-uring`, the NVMe codec must stay
sans-IO — which the compiler checks and a convention would not.

## Status

Early development. Milestones and progress are tracked in
`docs/architecture.md`; interoperability is validated continuously
against the Linux kernel NVMe/TCP and NVMe/RDMA host drivers (VM gates
over loopback/rxe, plus data-integrity and performance gates on real
100 GbE RDMA hardware).
