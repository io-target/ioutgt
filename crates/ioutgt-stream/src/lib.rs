//! Protocol-neutral ZC-aware gather-send harness for stream transports.
//!
//! A stream transport (NVMe/TCP today, NBD next) drains an ordered
//! [`SendList<W>`] of completed work, packs each item's headers into a
//! per-batch arena and references its payload in place from the slot
//! buffers, and ships the whole batch as one vectored `sendmsg` — or
//! `SENDMSG_ZC` under zero-copy mode, gating slot reuse on the kernel's
//! zero-copy notification. All of that machinery — the double-buffered
//! batches, short-send resume, the ZC pin-budget fallback to copying,
//! the notification reaping, the anti-deadlock drain, and the
//! release-tag timing — is protocol-agnostic and lives here in
//! [`StreamSender`].
//!
//! The one transport-specific concern is *staging one work item*:
//! encoding its protocol headers into the [`GatherBatch`] and saying how
//! its slot tag is released ([`Staged`]). The transport passes that as a
//! closure; the harness never inspects `W`.
//!
//! Sits above `ioutgt-core` (slot engine) and `ioutgt-uring` (reactor)
//! in the DAG, keeping both leaves free of each other — see the crate
//! map in `docs/architecture.md` §4.
