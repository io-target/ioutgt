//! Provided-buffer ring for multishot receive.
//!
//! A `BufRing` owns a kernel-registered ring of fixed-size receive
//! buffers (the `bgid` group). A multishot `RECV` ([`crate::ops::recv_multi`])
//! draws one buffer per completion from this group instead of taking a
//! caller buffer per op, so a single submitted op keeps receiving as data
//! arrives. After consuming a buffer's bytes the caller hands it back with
//! [`BufRing::recv_done`]; running the group dry terminates the multishot
//! with `-ENOBUFS`, after which the caller replenishes and re-arms.
//!
//! One ring serves exactly ONE connection: each connection that enables the
//! ring creates and owns its own `BufRing` (its own `bgid`, its own 2
//! sub-buffers, its own offset/waker state). A recv CQE reports only
//! `(bid, len)`, not the per-buffer consume offset; with a single consumer
//! per ring the running offset can be tracked locally and can never desync.
//! (Sharing one ring across connections is unsafe: their tasks do not drain
//! CQEs in completion order, so a shared offset would cross connections'
//! bytes.) `bgid`s are handed out by a thread-local allocator
//! (`alloc_bgid`) so the connections multiplexed onto one io_uring get
//! distinct group ids; the id is freed back on [`BufRing`] drop.
//!
//! Layout follows the kernel ABI: an array of `io_uring_buf` entries whose
//! first entry's `resv` field doubles as the shared tail (see
//! [`BufRingEntry::tail`]). We publish provided buffers by writing the entry
//! then storing the advanced tail with release ordering.
