# Roadmap

What exists today: a hardened, interop-verified NVMe/TCP target —
discover/connect/IO against stock Linux hosts, R2T writes, digests,
runtime namespace management with AENs, O_DIRECT file/bdev backend,
ASAN-clean, failure-injection tested, 506K 4K IOPS on loopback with
two IO threads. This file orders what comes next.

## 1. Performance (continuation of M9; each step measured in isolation)

- **Multishot recv + provided buffer rings** (`IOU_PBUF_RING`,
  `ENOBUFS` → single-shot fallback): removes the recv re-arm SQE and
  the owned-buffer round trip per batch. The `RecvSource` seam in the
  transport was designed for exactly this swap.
- ~~Direct-to-slot payload recv~~ — **done** (2026-06-11): large H2C
  tails land in the slot via one `MSG_WAITALL` raw recv; −44% target
  cycles/IOP on 128 KiB writes, 4K flat; kept at threshold 16 KiB.
  Numbers in `docs/perf-notes.md`. Reminder for the multishot item
  above: the bypass is irreconcilable with provided buffers on one
  connection (kernel picks the buffer) — landing multishot means a
  per-connection strategy choice.
- **Registered (fixed) slot buffers + `READ_FIXED`/`WRITE_FIXED`** for
  the O_DIRECT backend: removes per-op page pinning; evaluate by
  CPU-per-IOP on ext4, not loopback IOPS.
- ~~`SEND_ZC` with notification-gated buffer reuse~~ — **landed
  opt-in** (2026-06-12, `--send-zc`): `SENDMSG_ZC` over the gather
  iovecs, double-buffered batches, payload tags release on the
  notification CQE, recv path parks on tag exhaustion. **Still
  open: real-NIC evaluation** — loopback falls back to copying
  (REPORT_USAGE confirms: `zc_copied == zc_batches`) and the default
  8 MiB `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` forces copy fallbacks under load, so the flag
  stays experimental until benched on hardware.
- **`RECV_ZC` (zcrx)**: requires NIC header-data split + flow
  steering; revisit when 100G hardware is on the bench.
- ~~Per-queue stats counters surfaced through `GET_STATS`~~ — **done**
  (2026-06-12): `Cell` counters snapshotted on the owning thread via a
  mailbox round trip, rendered by `ioutgt stat` (`-i` for rates);
  A/B-verified free.
- Recv/send **budget tuning** (configurable, swept), optional second
  **IOPOLL ring** per thread for disk ops, `OpEntry` slab/waker
  micro-costs.

## 2. Benchmark vs kernel nvmet (deferred by request)

Everything needed is in place: `docs/benchmark-plan.md` (methodology),
`bench`-ready loadgen, the VM harness, and
`testing/capture-nvmet-fixtures.sh` shows the configfs setup that
`bench/setup-nvmet.sh` will reuse. Needs root (nvmet configfs, loop
devices, real NIC runs) and quiet-machine time. Deliverable:
`docs/benchmark-report.md` with IOPS/BW/p99/CPU-per-IOP and
flamegraphs for both targets, plus the loop-device validation of the
bdev backend path.

## 3. New transports (the framework bet)

2026-06-12: the prerequisite transport-abstraction refactor landed
(transport contract in architecture.md §5.1).
NBD is next; NVMe/RDMA after.

The split that makes this tractable: `ioutgt-core` is the
protocol-neutral queue engine (a dependency-free leaf); `ioutgt-nvme`
is the NVMe crate — sans-IO codec modules plus the transport-independent
model (dispatch/controllers) — layered on it. A transport supplies the
six obligations of the transport contract (setup → install → recv path
→ slot task body → send path → teardown) using its own `SlotArray<C>` +
`SendList<W>` instantiation. NVMe/TCP's `connection.rs` (now
`ioutgt-nvme-tcp`) is the template.

- **NVMe/RDMA** (`ioutgt-rdma`): same fabrics/core unchanged; the
  transport maps `SendWork::Response`/data to RDMA SEND/WRITE and
  R2T-equivalents to RDMA READ. Queue-thread model survives intact
  (one CQ per thread polled from the reactor — investigate io_uring
  attached verbs vs libibverbs polling integration; the mailbox/park
  design accommodates an extra fd-pollable CQ channel).
- **NBD** (`ioutgt-nbd`): much simpler wire protocol; maps onto slots
  with synthetic tags (NBD handles are 64-bit cookies — store the
  cookie in the slot like the CID). Good second transport to prove
  the abstraction because it is *not* NVMe-shaped.
- **iSCSI** (`ioutgt-iscsi`): largest protocol surface (login,
  task management, R2T-like data-out); slot model maps via ITT.
  Last in line.

## 4. Protocol/robustness backlog

- Gentler error responses where nvmet degrades per-command instead of
  terminating: queue-depth overrun handling (DDGST mismatch →
  `DATA_XFER_ERROR` per command is done).
- **IO-queue teardown on controller removal**: admin keep-alive expiry
  shuts down only the admin socket and drops the registry entry — the
  controller's IO-queue sockets are never shut down, so an IO queue
  wedged on a stalling host (recv pending forever) survives its own
  controller's teardown. Found by adversarial review of the
  direct-slot-recv merge; pre-existing (a buffered recv wedges
  identically). Fix shape: controller removal shuts down its installed
  IO-queue fds — the registry has the qid routing records but holds no
  fd today, so teardown needs a shutdown handle per installed queue
  (nvmet analog: `nvmet_ctrl_fatal_error` schedules all queues dead).
- **Mailbox sends to a dead queue thread accumulate forever**: the
  sender queues unconditionally, so if a queue thread exited (runtime
  init failure), every NsChanged nudge or stats request leaks one
  queued message (bytes per event; `ioutgt stat -i` makes it steady).
  Found by review of the stats work; pre-existing class. Fix shape: a
  closed flag on the mailbox set when the receiver drops.
- RAE semantics on log pages; real SMART/error-log content; Get Log
  Page offset support beyond discovery.
- **Persistent discovery controllers**: discovery genctr maintenance
  (bump on subsystem add/remove instead of the hardcoded 1), the
  DISC_CHANGE AEN fired to connected discovery controllers on topology
  changes (nvmet: `nvmet_port_disc_changed`), and OAES advertising
  DISC_CHANGE instead of NS_ATTR on discovery controllers — the host
  masks its AEC against OAES, so without the bit the notice is never
  enabled (same trap as NS_ATTR on IO controllers). One coherent work
  item; becomes load-bearing once runtime subsystem add or multi-port
  lands.
- **Wildcard-traddr fixup in discovery log entries**: a target bound to
  `0.0.0.0` (the default `--listen`) advertises `0.0.0.0` verbatim as
  traddr, which `nvme connect-all` would try to dial. nvmet substitutes
  the connection's actual local address via the `disc_traddr` transport
  callback (`nvmet_tcp_disc_port_addr`); ioutgt should do the same —
  use the accepted socket's local address when the configured traddr is
  a wildcard. The entry's hardcoded `adrfam = IPv4` should be derived
  from the same address while at it.
- Host ACLs (per-subsystem allowed-host lists) in config + control
  API.
- **Multiple ports**: one process currently serves one listen address
  (`spawn_target()` binds a single listener; nvmet allows N ports with
  subsystems linked into each). The model is already port-shaped —
  `PortConfig` carries traddr/trsvcid plus its own subsystem map — so
  the work is assembly and config: a `ports` array in the JSON schema
  (each with listen address, digest policy, subsystem list), one accept
  loop per port on the control thread routing into the *shared* queue
  threads, per-port discovery log pages, and port identity in
  `GET_STATS`. Queue threads and the registry need no changes;
  controllers are already keyed by (subsystem, host), not by port.
- TLS (kTLS or userspace) for NVMe/TCP secure channels.
- ~~bdev discard/write-zeroes via `IORING_OP_URING_CMD`~~ — **done**
  (2026-08-26): `ops::block_discard` (`BLOCK_URING_CMD_DISCARD`) for DSM
  and the fallocate chain for Write Zeroes on bdevs, gated by
  `testing/vmtest/ioutgt_bdev_discard.sh` (root-in-guest loop device:
  allocated blocks drop, zeroed range reads back zero). NVMe
  passthrough backend over uring-cmd to a host controller.
- ~~bdev LBA size from the device instead of the fixed 512 B~~ — **done**
  (2026-08-26): `FileBackend::open` probes `BLKSSZGET` (bdev, uncapped) /
  `statx` DIO offset alignment else `st_blksize` (file, capped 4 KiB),
  floored 512 B; the loop-device
  guest test runs at `--sector-size 4096` and asserts the host sees 4 KiB
  LBAs. Still open: `npwg`/`nows` from the physical block size for 512e
  drives (perf hint, not correctness).
- Metadata/PI formats, Write Protect, reservations — driven by
  demand.

## 5. Operational

- ~~Per-queue/throughput counters in `GET_STATS`~~ — **done**
  (2026-06-12, see §1); an optional Prometheus text endpoint on the
  control socket would build on the same per-thread JSON.
- Graceful shutdown command (drain + SHST_COMPLETE on all
  controllers) instead of process kill.
- Packaging: systemd unit, config reload via control socket.
- libFuzzer targets built on the existing seeded-fuzz drivers; CI
  recipe (fmt, clippy, test, ASAN job, VM suite as a manual gate).
