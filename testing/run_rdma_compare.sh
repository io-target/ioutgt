# Build the ioutgt-nvme-rdma target (release) on the host, then run the
# NVMe/RDMA A/B comparison inside the vmtest guest: ioutgt-nvme-rdma vs the
# in-kernel nvmet-rdma target, both driven through testing/local_tgt.sh with
# TRANSPORT=rdma over soft-RoCE, gated by a crc32c fio --verify on each.
#
# The guest sees the repo read-only over 9p and runs the entrypoint by path
# (it calls ./testing/local_tgt.sh), so — unlike run_rdma_connect.sh — there is
# nothing to copy into the vmtest tests dir; we just point vmtest at the script.
